## Homework 1

### Formulation Of The Problem
Compare the implementation of library function 
  1. np.linalg.solve for **the Gaussian elimination**,
  2. np.linalg.cholesky for **the Cholesky decomposition**,
  3. scipy.linalg.solve_banded for **the sweep algorithm**,

with your own implementation of corresponding method for solving SLE (system of linear equations) on a random matrix with a diagonal prevalence of 100 x 100, 200 x 200, etc. size. Carry out several experiments until the counting time is less than a second. Build dependency graphs. 

----------------

#### Gaussian Elimination
Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm in linear algebra for solving a system of linear equations.

Problem: solve the SLE **`Ax = f`**.

Let **`A`** be a square matrix. The idea refers to the factorization of **`A`**, with proper row and/or column orderings or permutations, into two factors â€“ a lower triangular matrix **`L`** and an upper triangular matrix **`U`** (which has units on the main diagonal): **`A = LU`** &#8594; **`LUx = f`**.

Forward Elimination: bring the matrix to an improved upper triangular form by elementary row operations:
**`Ux = L_{-1} f`**

Back Substitution: to diagonalize matrix by elementary row transformations:
 **`x = U^{-1} L^{-1} f`** 

Gaussian elimination has arithmetic complexity of *O(n3)*.

----------------

#### Cholesky Decomposition

The Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. The Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as the LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations.

The Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix **`A`** is a decomposition of the form **`A = [L][L]^T`**, where **`L`** is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries, and **`L^{T}`** denotes the conjugate transpose of **`L`**. 

The following formulas are obtained by solving above lower triangular matrix and its transpose. These are the basis of Cholesky Decomposition Algorithm :

The computational complexity of commonly used algorithms is *O(n3)* in general.

----------------

#### Sweep Algorithm
In numerical linear algebra, the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, also known as the sweep algorithm, is a simplified form of Gaussian elimination that can be used to solve tridiagonal systems of equations. A tridiagonal system for *n* unknowns may be written as

For such systems, the solution can be obtained in *O(n)*.

### Project Overview 

After starting, a menu of 4 items will appear:  
              ![Equation](../pics/choose.png)


Enter one of the items and the corresponding program starts.

  Output data   | Description
  ------------- | -------------
  n             | Matrix dimension.
  Error         | Error (the infinity norm of the difference between my and numpy.
  My time       | Time of my calculations for the matrix nxn.
  Numpy time    | The computation time of the library function for the matrix nxn.

The dimension of the matrix increases until the time of my calculations exceeds 
1 seconds. When the time exceeds 1 second, the calculations for the selected 
method stop and a graph is displayed. The graph shows the dependence of the time 
of calculations on the size of the matrix.

After closing the graph, the menu reappears.
